  ## Bio
  Shmuela Jacobs, GDE, is a front-end instructor, consultant, developer, speaker, and community activist. She is the founder of ngGirls - an initiative aiming to increase diversity in the programming world.

  Shmuela received her M.Sc. in Information Management Engineering from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, where she had researched systems modeling languages in collaboration with IBM Research and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). During her studies she has gained experience in several software development environments and languages (C++, JAVA, Python), both as a researcher and a software engineer at Intelâ€™s Israel Development Center. This has been a career change for her, after receiving B.Sc. in Physics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel, and working in both science museums in Israel.

  Since her graduation Shmuela has shifted to front-end and has been developing with AngularJS and Angular. She combines her passions for coding and teaching by sharing her knowledge and experience in meetups, conferences and ngGirls workshops around the world. Shmuela lives in Givatayim (near Tel-Aviv) with her husband, their 10 m/o son, their deaf Labrador and one-eyed ginger cat.

  ## Bio 
  I wrote my first program at 11 on a Sharp MZ-700, my first job after University was working at the European Space Agency in their Mission Control Centre. Since then Iâ€™ve done stretches at Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan as well as a bit of contracting at Google.
  I have experience with a wide variety of technologies, but I primarily focus these days on Python & JavaScript. I have a deep background in consulting and in the past few years have spent a lot of time engaging with the various JavaScript communities through writing, creating online courses while also speaking all over Europe, the USA, and the Middle East.
